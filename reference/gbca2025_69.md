## Details

Data are stored in the form of a contingency table, with drugs listed
across the columns and the 69 AEs presented across the rows. Each cell
in the contingency table represents the total report counts associated
with that (AE, drug) pair and detected in the FDA FAERS database during
2021Q1 - 2024Q4.

The dataset catalogs 7 Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents (GBCAs) (across
columns):

Gadobenate, Gadobutrol, Gadodiamide, Gadopentetate, Gadoterate,
Gadoteridol, Gadoxetate.

The 69 adverse events presented across the rows are selected from 1328
AEs of gbca2025 which are related to the brain or neural system. Other
AEs are collapsed to one reference row: "Other AEs".
