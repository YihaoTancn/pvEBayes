# Generate a heatmap plot visualizing posterior probabilities for selected drugs and adverse events

This function generates a heatmap to visualize the posterior
probabilities of being a signal for selected AEs and drugs.

## Usage

``` r
heatmap_pvEBayes(
  x,
  num_top_AEs = 10,
  num_top_drugs = 8,
  specified_AEs = NULL,
  specified_drugs = NULL,
  cutoff_signal = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- x:

  a `pvEBayes` object, which is the output of the function
  [pvEBayes](https://yihaotancn.github.io/pvEBayes/reference/pvEBayes.md)
  or
  [pvEBayes_tune](https://yihaotancn.github.io/pvEBayes/reference/pvEBayes_tune.md).

- num_top_AEs:

  number of most significant AEs appearing in the plot. Default to 10.

- num_top_drugs:

  number of most significant drugs appearing in the plot. Default to 7.

- specified_AEs:

  a vector of AE names that are specified to appear in the plot. If a
  vector of AEs is given, argument num_top_AEs will be ignored.

- specified_drugs:

  a vector of drug names that are specified to appear in the plot. If a
  vector of drugs is given, argument num_top_drugs will be ignored.

- cutoff_signal:

  numeric. Threshold for signal detection. An AE-drug combination is
  classified as a detected signal if its 5th posterior percentile
  exceeds this threshold.

## Value

a ggplot2 object.

## Examples

``` r
fit <- pvEBayes(
  contin_table = statin2025_44, model = "general-gamma",
  alpha = 0.3, n_posterior_draws = 1000
)


heatmap_pvEBayes(
  x = fit,
  num_top_AEs = 10,
  num_top_drugs = 8,
  specified_AEs = NULL,
  specified_drugs = NULL,
  cutoff_signal = 1.001
)

```
