## Details

Data are stored in the form of a contingency table, with drugs listed
across the columns and the 44 AEs presented across the rows. Each cell
in the contingency table represents the total report counts associated
with that (AE, drug) pair and detected in the FDA FAERS database during
2021Q1 - 2024Q4.

The dataset catalogs 6 statin drugs (across columns):

Atorvastatin, Fluvastatin, Lovastatin, Pravastatin, Rosuvastatin and
Simvastatin.

The 44 adverse events presented across the rows are considered
significant by FDA.

This dataset is an updated version of statin46 from the pvLRT package
which collect the same scope of AEs for 6 statin drugs for quarters
2014Q3 - 2020Q4.

During 2021Q1 - 2024Q4, there was no AE report for "BLOOD CREATINE
PHOSPHOKINASE MM INCREASED" and "MYOGLOBIN BLOOD PRESENT". Therefore,
these two AEs are not presented in the statin2025_44 dataset.
