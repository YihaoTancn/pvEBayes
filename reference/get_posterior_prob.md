# Obtain posterior probability of being a signal

Obtain posterior probability of being a signal

## Usage

``` r
get_posterior_prob(obj, cutoff_signal = 1.001)
```

## Arguments

- obj:

  a `pvEBayes` object, which is the output of the function
  [pvEBayes](https://yihaotancn.github.io/pvEBayes/reference/pvEBayes.md)
  or
  [pvEBayes_tune](https://yihaotancn.github.io/pvEBayes/reference/pvEBayes_tune.md).

- cutoff_signal:

  numeric. Threshold for signal detection. An AE-drug combination is
  classified as a detected signal if its 5th posterior percentile
  exceeds this threshold.

## Value

a matrix
