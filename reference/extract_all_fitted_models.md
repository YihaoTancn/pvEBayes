# Extract all fitted models from a tuned pvEBayes Object

This function retrieves the list of all fitted models from a
pvEBayes_tuned object, which is the output of the
[`pvEBayes_tune()`](https://yihaotancn.github.io/pvEBayes/reference/pvEBayes_tune.md)
function.

## Usage

``` r
extract_all_fitted_models(object)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  An object of class `pvEBayes_tuned`, usually returned by
  [`pvEBayes_tune`](https://yihaotancn.github.io/pvEBayes/reference/pvEBayes_tune.md).
  This function will throw an error if the input is not of the correct
  class.

## Value

A list containing the results of each model fitted during the tuning
process.

## Examples

``` r
valid_matrix <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), nrow = 2)
rownames(valid_matrix) <- c("AE_1", "AE_2")
colnames(valid_matrix) <- c("drug_1", "drug_2", "drug_3", "drug_4")

tuned_object <- pvEBayes_tune(valid_matrix,
  model = "general-gamma",
  return_all_fit = TRUE
