## Details

Data are stored in the form of a contingency table, with drugs listed
across the columns and the 1328 AEs presented across the rows. Each cell
in the contingency table represents the total report counts associated
with that (AE, drug) pair and detected in the FDA FAERS database during
2021Q1 - 2024Q4.

The dataset catalogs 7 Gadolinium-Based Contrast Agents (GBCAs):

Gadobenate, Gadobutrol, Gadodiamide, Gadopentetate, Gadoterate,
Gadoteridol, Gadoxetate

The 1328 adverse events presented across the rows are AEs that contain
at least one report for the 7 GBCA drugs during 2021Q1 - 2024Q4.

This dataset is an updated version of gbca from the pvLRT package which
collects the same scope of AEs for 7 gbca drugs for quarters 2014Q3 -
2020Q4.
